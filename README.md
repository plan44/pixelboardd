# pixelboardd - daemon for games/display on 20x10 LED WS281x "pixelboard"

**work in progress!**

For running on OpenWrt/LEDE targets such as Onion Omega1/Omega2, you may want to use the [pixelboardd](https://github.com/plan44/plan44-feed/tree/for-lede-master/pixelboardd) and [pixelboard-config](https://github.com/plan44/plan44-feed/tree/for-lede-master/pixelboard-config) packages from the `for-lede-master`  branch of [plan44 feed](https://github.com/plan44/plan44-feed/tree/for-lede-master).

All the drawings for lasercutting a 80x40cm pixelboard and the PCB designs for LED connectors, touch panels and onion omega2 based controller can be found in the [pixelboard-hardware repository](https://github.com/plan44/pixelboard-hardware).
